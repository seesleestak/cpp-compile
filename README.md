# cpp-compile
Fun little bash script that compiles and runs C++ programs when it detects a change in `*.cpp` files from the current (or sub) directory. Not groundbreaking, just an exercise to alleviate excessive compiling with small programs.

## Usage
Run the script in the directory for which you want to listen for file changes.
